/**
 * This program "fakes" a text adventure game using Javascript and GPT.

 * GPT with some high level instructions, the last few GPT responses

 *
 * If the user "plays along" the experience is suprisingly similar to a true
 * text adventure game. But the user can easily "break" the game by issuing
 * outlandish commands.

Adopt a New Yorker's toneâ€”direct, witty, and a bit cynical.
Narrate in second person, keeping it real and grounded.
Give life to the bustling streets, the diverse characters, and the city's unending energy.
When describing actions or locations, add a touch of the city's humor and sharpness.

The player's command is '${command}'.
